						People tend to like their beverages a certain way—their cocktails
						straight up versus on the rocks, their water still versus
						carbonated, their soda diet versus regular, and their coffee with
						countless flavors, milk, and other customizations.
					</p>

					<p class="post__paragraph">
						Whether it's a creamy iced latte, a foamy cappuccino, or a piping
						hot cup of black brew, coffee drinkers tend to be exceptionally
						loyal and consistent. In a survey released in April 2023, the
						National Coffee Association found 65% of adults had coffee within
						the last day, but how they took their coffee varied widely.
					</p>

					<p class="post__paragraph">
						In the United States, coffee isn't just a vehicle for caffeine—it's
						a key part of morning routines, the drink of choice when catching up
						with an old friend, and a way to prolong a date that's going well.
						But not all of the 50 states are created equal when it comes to
						coffee culture. The latest NCA survey found coffee consumption
						varies by age and region.
					</p>

					<p class="post__paragraph">
						We compiled a list of some facts and statistics about how Americans
						consume coffee using data from the NCA's Spring 2023 report to get a
						glimpse at current coffee culture in the U.S.

						Almost two-thirds of Americans drank coffee within the past day
					</h3>

					<p class="post__paragraph">
						As proof of coffee's popularity, 65% of survey respondents said they
						had coffee within the past day. If that statistic were to hold for
						all people over 18 across the U.S., which is about 260 million
						people, that would amount to 169 million people drinking coffee
						daily.
					</p>

					<p class="post__paragraph">
						The survey results also showed more people drank coffee than water
						in the last 24 hours—56% said they had bottled water and 45% said
						they drank tap water during the same time. It's also more popular
						than tea, juice, and soda.

						Far more Americans over 60 drink coffee daily than those in their
						early 20s
					</h3>

					<p class="post__paragraph">
						The older you are, the longer you've had to build a coffee-drinking
						habit. The survey results show that older folks drink coffee more
						than younger people: 69% of Americans over 60 drank coffee in the
						past day, compared to just 47% of 18- to 24-year-olds who said the
						same. However, once survey respondents hit 25, it seems coffee
						consumption skyrocketed: 66% of respondents 25 to 39 and 67% aged 40
						to 59 had had a cup of Joe within the last day.
